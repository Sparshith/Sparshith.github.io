<p>Ted Kaczynski was a child prodigy, who had an IQ of 167 and enrolled at Harvard university at 16. He was fascinated by Math, and topped his class at Harvard, and then got his PhD at the University of Michigan,and at age 25, he was an assistant professor at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>But he is not known for any of this. He's notoriously known as the Unabomber, because of his 17-year terror campaign against professors, technologists and businesspeople (His early victims were associated with <i>un</i>iversities or <i>a</i>irlines, hence the name 'Unabomber').</p>
<p>For a long time, the authorities could simply not track down the identity of this bomber. In 1995, Kaczynski anonymously mailed a 35000 word manifesto to the New York times and promised to halt the terror attacks if they published it. They did, with the FBI also hoping that someone would recognize the style of writing. Someone did. Kaczynski's brother recognized it, and turned him in.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel analyses the manifesto extremely well in his book "Zero to One". The manifesto, although you might expect it to show signs of insanity is quite logical. Kaczynski claimed that in order to be happy, every Individual "needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals". He divided goals that humans have into three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Goals that can be satisfied with <strong><em>minimal effort</em></strong>;</li>
<li>Goals that can be satisfied with <em><strong>serious effort</strong></em>; and</li>
<li>Goals that cannot be satisfied, <em><strong>no matter how much effort</strong></em> one      makes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kaczynski argued that a whole lot of modern people are depressed because all of the world's hard problems have been solved. What's left to do is either easy or impossible, and pursuing those tasks is deeply unsatisfying, or endlessly frustrating. So his idea was to destroy existing institutions, get rid of all technology and let people start over and work on hard problems anew.</p>
<p>Sure, Kaczynski's methods were outright crazy, but his loss of faith in the technological frontier, and more importantly, in finding secrets is all around us.</p>
