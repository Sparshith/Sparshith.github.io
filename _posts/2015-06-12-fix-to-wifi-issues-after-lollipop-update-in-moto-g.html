<p>I finally decided to update my phone from Kitkat to Lollipop after it kept throwing up notifications every 2 seconds. And boom, the WiFi connection I had used for about a year simply refused to connect, or even get detected, while a few other WiFi connections were showing up.</p>
<p>This is what worked for me.</p>
<p>1. Open any browser.<br />
2. Enter Router Ip address. (Always starts with 192.168, and is usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.2 for Linksys and Belkin correspondingly)3. Enter Login details. This will usually be present at the back of your router.<br />
4. Select "Wireless", which will be present on the left hand side.<br />
5. In theÂ  "Wireless channel" field, select channel 6 and click on apply.<br />
6. Restart the router and your phone.</p>
