No, the tutorial had a different title. Really.

Sorry about that, just trying to see if gifs work.<br><br>
I am starting this blog for multiple reasons. 
I want to build this blog from the ground-up, hopefully learning cool things along the way.
I have decided that it's going to be handcoded in vim mostly because it sounds cool.  
But honestly, I just want to document things that I learn, on a daily basis.

Most importantly, if you find any errors in the content that I put up,  wish to give me any feedback or generally chat over a cup of coffee or a slice of pizza , please mail me at sparshithsampath@gmail.com or call me on 09901149676.

<b><i>Daily shots</i></b> for today will be really short.<br>

<b>Article of the day</b>: <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">How to set up Jekyll on Github pages</a><br>
<b>Sandcastle of the day</b>: Porting all the posts from my wordpress blog to this one.<br>

Things I learnt today:
1) .md files don't recognize normal end of lines. Had to use html linebreak(br) tags. <br> 
2) Path to github userprofile picture: <a href="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8277740?v=2&s=460">https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8277740?v=2&s=460</a> where 8277740 is my github user_id. To find yours, use http://caius.github.io/github_id/.
