<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the link. It will open a google spreadsheet. Sign in to your google account, if you are already not. Click on "File" and then on "Make a copy". This will give you editing rights. Give it a whirl.</li>
<li>Wrap is set true to all cells on Open. Just in case it doesn't wrap after you've entered text, refresh the page.</li>
<li>Select the cell which contains the motion and choose the appropriate menu option.</li>
<li>The sortedMotions sheet will have the motions sorted to the category you chose, and the row that contains the motion will be coloured appropriately.</li>
</ol>
<p>Drop a mail at sparshithsampath@gmail.com, if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>
