Sandcastle built. Really.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gmfq9lV.gif)

<br><br>
Ported all posts from my wordpress blog.<br>
I had to search quite a bit to get the exact procedure. Here is what worked for me.<br>
1. Go to <yourblogname>.wordpress.com/wp-admin/ <br>
2. Click on tools and select export and an xml file gets downloaded. <br>
3. Install jekyll-import: gem install jekyll-import. <br>
4. Run this command : <br>
	<pre>
	ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
    	JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({
      		"source" => "<yourdownloadedfilename>.xml",
      		"no_fetch_images" => false,
      		"assets_folder" => "assets"
    	})'
	
   Note: Might have to install few dependencies. Just look out for any suggestions outputted.
	</pre><br>
5. You will get _posts with html files in them of all your posts. Simply move them to your _posts folder. <br>
6. Git add, git commit, git push and we're live. <br>
7. I also modified _layouts/default to html and added a favicon. <br>




 
<b><i>Daily shots</i></b> for the day.<br>
<b>Repo of the day</b>: <a href="https://github.com/rafaelrinaldi/hn-cli"> CLI to browse Hacker News</a>. Really interesting stuff. Has become my go-to command whenevr I'm bored.<br>
<b>Article of the day</b>: <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/">Startup Interviewing is Fucked</a>. The language is a little strong, but I completely agree with the sentiment.<br>
<b>Sandcastle of the day</b>: (Suggestions from Mum take high priority, so) adding functionality to comment.<br>

Things I learnt today:
1)  Locks in redis. <br> 
2) Faster verisons of push() and ushift() in javascript. <br>
Will update both of these tomorrow.
