<p>Consider these questions:</p>
<p>1. Two people A and B have interests (x,n) and (m,n) correspondingly, and are working together.<br />
<strong><em>Will including C with interests(x,m) be good for the A and B?</em></strong></p>
<p>2. In Northern France, news broke out regarding a strange "Association of the Broken Dish". Some Industrialists had met for dinner, and during the meal, a dish fell on the floor and broke. One of them noticed that the number of pieces were identical to that of those present. One of them considered this an omen, and , in consequence of it, they founded a society of friends who owed one another service and help. Each of them took a part of the dish home with him. If one one of them dies, his piece is sent to the president, who would then glue the fragment with his piece. The last survivor will fit the last piece, whereupon the reconstituted dish is to be constructed and buried along with the last survivor when he passes away.<br />
<em><strong>Was it right to have a predetermined timestamp for it's end, from the moment it began, or should it have included new members and perpetuated the life of the society indefinitely.?</strong></em></p>
<p>3. You want some help with chores around the house.<br />
<strong><em>Do you hire one servant to do job x, or two servants both of who perform x/2?</em></strong></p>
<p>4. Assuming you live in a society that encourages polygamy and polyandry and you will have more than one spouse,<br />
<em><strong>Would it make more sense restrict the number of spouses to 2? </strong></em></p>
<p>5.Since the Camp David accord of 1978 signed by then President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian President Anwar Saddat and Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, the US has supplied to both Israel and Egypt massive amounts of aid.<br />
<em><strong>Does US aid to both Egypt and Israel reduce the likelihood of these Middle Eastern countries being involved in militarized disputes?</strong></em></p>
<p>6. Two entities compromise on their individual identities enter into monogamous marriages, in order to attain happiness from becoming a different kind of atomic unit. This can lead to two possible scenarios. Either the marriage can work, and the two entities are satisfied with the bond, or it doesn't work, and the entities are unhappy and are intrinsically alienated. In the first scenario, it doesn't make sense to add a 3rd entity to the group, as it has the potential to create hostility in the group, and reduce happiness. In the second, it doesn't make sense introducing a third member, even assuming both entities will care for the third member, as it makes them forcefully interact with each other more and increase the bitterness and discomfort.<br />
<em><strong>So, why do couples choose to have kid(s)?</strong></em></p>
<p>Common knowledge dictates that the "individual" is the fundamental atom in the psychological universe. And at the other end of the spectrum lies "society". We have psychiatry, which studies the psyches of individuals, and sociology, which studies social relations. But an amalgamation of both of these ideas gives rise to something quite interesting. Is there a "smallest stable social unit", and if there is, what is it?</p>
<p>(Some extreme advocates of the social unit even suggest that it should replace the preconceived ideas of individuality being the smallest unit. Surprisingly(or not), one of such advocates was the professor of Ted Kaczynski, Harry Murray. There are some interesting arguments supporting this claim as well.)</p>
<p>The obvious choice to be considered first is a group of two entities<strong>, </strong>or as referred by sociologists, a <strong>dyad. </strong>Examples of Dyadic relations range between marriages to International alliances. There are some strong arguments for why the dyad is the desirable social unit. Individual identities of both participants are largely preserved in a Dyad. The life of a Dyad is dependent on both entities and they share equal responsibility. Interactions are direct, and the lack of a third party reduces the room for miscommunication and misunderstanding. <em>But</em> (c'mon, you saw it coming), the tricky part is to recognize that the death of a Dyad requires only one entity. A dyad has a limited, finite lifetime. In case of a conflict, without a third person to arbitrate or adjudicate, it can lead to withdrawal, and hence the dissolution of the group. Does this make it unstable? In short, the Dyad represents both the first social synthesis and unification, and the first separation and anti-thesis.</p>
<p>The next logical option to be considered is a group of 3 people, or a <strong>triad. </strong>There are various forms of a triad, and a few of them will be discussed here. If the third member is a non-partisan entity, it helps the communication between entities in a dyadic conflict. The two members in the conflict have a higher probability of being objective when there is an intermediate non-partisan entity talking to both sides and helping them coming to a conclusion. If the third member is an entity that aids two other members who might be in conflict, the third member can influence, and sometimes even coerce the two members to conclude the conflict. One common advantage across all triads is that,the group's death is not in the control of any single entity.<br />
<em>But, </em>a triad challenges the individuality of the members. A majority within a triad can mean that one entity's views and opinions can be overruled and completely ignored. Also, there's a very likely possibility of two members forming a strong bond amongst each other, and therefore the feeling of jealousy, or indifference can harm the stability of the group.</p>
<p>The next logical option..interestingly, no, that's it. In principle, there is not much difference between 3 members and larger number of members in a group. Dyad thus has more specific features. An addition of one member changes up a lot of things. But an addition to a triad, still retains most properties as that of a triad.</p>
<p>The final thing left to do now is to revisit all those questions and check if it's a little bit easier to arrive at an answer.</p>
